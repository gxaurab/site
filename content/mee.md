Hello and welcome to my website! My name is *Gaurab Wagle*, and I am a 20-year-old student at *Kathmandu University*, studying Computer Science. When I'm not studying, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors through hiking and traveling. In addition to my love for adventure, I have a keen interest in **economics**, **stocks**, **world current** **affairs**, and **AI**. I am excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you through this website, and I hope you find it informative and enjoyable!

I am also an enthusiastic beginner programmer, and I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. I believe that technology has the power to shape our world in incredible ways, and I am excited to be a part of this dynamic field. Through this website, I hope to share my journey as a programmer, as well as offer insights and resources that may be helpful to others on a similar path. :smiley:
